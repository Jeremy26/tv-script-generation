# tv-script-generation
Natural Language Generation (NLG) using RNN to generate tv scripts

Works well with tensorflow 1.3; avoid 1.4 as there are difficulties with LSTM cells.

Here is the generated text :

**moe_szyslak:**(cheering up) yeah. yeah, you know, that actually makes me feel bad as they wanted to even beloved!
**carl_carlson:**(hurt chuckle) well, thank all your money for my best friend.
